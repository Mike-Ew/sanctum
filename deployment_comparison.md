- Same sidebar settings (AI Model, Prayer Numbers, Scripture Slides)
- Same main content area with YouTube URL input
- Same expandable sections (Example Output, Manual Testing, API Key info)
- Same footer message

## Technical Differences

### Deployment Configuration
The deployed version uses:
- Streamlit Cloud hosting
- Secrets management via Streamlit Cloud
- Public URL: sanctum.streamlit.app
- Production environment

The local version uses:
- Local development server
- Environment variables or .env file
- Localhost URL: localhost:8502
- Development environment

## Recommendations

1. **Sync Features**: Both versions appear to be running the same `app_v3_ai.py` code, which is good for consistency.

2. **Environment Variables**: Consider documenting the difference in how API keys are loaded:
   - Production: Streamlit secrets
   - Development: .env file

3. **Version Control**: The deployed version matches the local version, indicating good deployment practices.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Update dependencies (OpenAI library is outdated)
   - Add version number display to help track deployments
   - Consider adding environment indicator (DEV/PROD)
