# Prayer Detection: Regex vs OpenAI Comparison

## Regex Approach (Current Implementation)

### Pros:
- **Free** - No API costs
- **Fast** - Instant processing
- **Offline** - Works without internet
- **Predictable** - Consistent results
- **Privacy** - Data stays local

### Cons:
- **Pattern Dependent** - Needs to match specific formats
- **Maintenance** - Requires updating patterns for new formats
- **Context Limited** - Can't understand nuanced prayer language

### Success Rate with Your Examples:
- ✅ Detects "Father..." prayer starters
- ✅ Finds scripture references (Psalm, Zechariah, etc.)
- ⚠️ Needs refinement for cleaner extraction
- ✅ Works with current prayer point format

## OpenAI Approach

### Pros:
- **Intelligent** - Understands context and meaning
- **Flexible** - Handles any prayer format
- **Accurate** - Better at identifying prayer boundaries
- **Low Maintenance** - No pattern updates needed

### Cons:
- **Costs Money** - ~$0.002 per sermon (GPT-3.5)
- **Internet Required** - Needs API connection
- **Slower** - API call latency
- **Privacy** - Data sent to OpenAI
- **Token Limits** - Long sermons need chunking

### Estimated Costs:
- GPT-3.5: ~$0.002 per sermon
- GPT-4: ~$0.02 per sermon
- Monthly (100 sermons): $0.20 - $2.00

## Recommendation

**Start with Regex** (current approach) because:
1. Your prayer format is structured and consistent
2. Free to operate
3. Fast and works offline
4. We can refine patterns based on real usage

**Add OpenAI as optional premium feature** later:
- Toggle in settings
- User provides their own API key
- Fallback to regex if API fails
- Best for complex/unstructured sermons

## Next Steps

1. Refine regex patterns for your specific format
2. Add configuration for custom prayer keywords
3. Implement OpenAI as optional feature
4. Test with more sermon samples
